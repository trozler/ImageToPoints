This code allows users to upload any image (png, jpeg, svg, gif) and the path corresponding to the svg equivilent of the image is printed to console.

### Important notes

- The number of sample points can be increased in `main.js`.
- This code makes use of a fork I made of the [imagetracerjs library](https://github.com/trozler/imagetracerjs). The API is used to convert an image to svg.

### How to run

- node.js: `npm install dropzone` and then of you go.
